                    <li>Custom resolution - We can provide 360 rotations especially designed for small mobile devices to
                        360 Product Photography tailored to UHD displays at 4K resolution.
                    </li>

                    <li>Custom frame rate - Ultra smooth to ultra fast loading. All our 360 Images will load as fast
                        but, for different applications our clients will need a different number of frames. Choose how
                        many frames we use for your 360 product shoot - from a, silky smooth, 90 frames per revolution
                        to an ultra quick loading 12 frames per spin.
                    </li>

                    <li>Hotspots - If you want to have more information displayed at points of interest on your product
                        we can add overlays and hotspots at any point on any frame.
                    </li>

                    <li>Full Screen - We can offer an enlarged version of the same image or a low / hi resolution
                        version.
                    </li>

                    <li>Zoom - Zoom in on the image for viewing extra detail of a particular product.</li>


                </ul>

                <h4>Store front display</h4>
                <p>If you are using your 360 Image in a shop window display load times will not be as important as
                    quality and 90 frames will give a buttery smooth rotation.</p>
                <h4>Web store / site</h4>
                <p>As a website owner Iâ€™m sure you know how important speed is to how how well you rank on Google
                    search. Light 360 rotations are what you want here. Cutting down the number of frames reduces the
                    file size of the 360 product and also the load time of the page, whilst still giving your customers
                    all the advantages of 360 degree photography. </p>
