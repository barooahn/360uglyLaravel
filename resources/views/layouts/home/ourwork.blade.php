                <h2>Why choose us for your 360 product photography?</h2>

                <p>We ensure the best combination of optimal image quality and file size for your 360 degree product.  This is most suitable for web applications where load times are as important as image quality.</p>  

                <p>All our images are optimised to have a small footprint - We use lossless compression technology for each image in the 360 rotation which gives the best quality at smallest file size availble.</p>

                <h2>If you require more features just ask</h2>
                <p>The default order is optimised for all web devices but if you have special requirements just drop us a message in an enquiry or with your order.</p>  

                <h3>We can offer the following extra features:</h3>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Custom resolution - We can provide 360 rotations especially designed for small mobile devices to 360 Product Photography tailored to UHD displays at 4K resolution.  </li>

                    <li>Custom frame rate - Ultra smooth to ultra fast loading.  All our 360 Images will load as fast but, for different applications our clients will need a different number of frames.  Choose how many frames we use for your 360 product shoot - from a, silky smooth, 90 frames per revolution to an ultra quick loading 12 frames per spin. 
                    </li>  

                    <li>Hotspots - If you want to have more information displayed at points of interest on your product we can add overlays and hotspots at any point on any frame.</li>   

                    <li>Full Screen -  We can offer an enlarged version of the same image or a low / hi resolution version.</li> 

                    <li>Zoom - Zoom in on the image for viewing extra detail of a particular product.</li>  


                </ul>

                <h4>Store front display</h4>
                <p>If you are using your 360 Image in a shop window display load times will not be as important as quality and 90 frames will give a buttery smooth rotation.</p>   
                <h4>Web store / site</h4>
                <p>As a website owner Iâ€™m sure you know how important speed is to how how well you rank on Google search.  Light 360 rotations are what you want here.  Cutting down the number of frames reduces the file size of the 360 product and also the load time of the page, whilst still giving your customers all the advantages of 360 degree photography.  </p>
