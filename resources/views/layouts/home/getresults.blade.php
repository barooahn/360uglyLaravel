                <p>If your clients remotely purchase your product they already have built up an idea of what the product will be like from your description and images.  If the product differs, even in a small way, than they imagined there is a possibility that they will return it.</p>  

                <p>Giving the customer the maximum amount of information possible helps them to build an accurate mental image of what they have purchased.  As the old adage goes a picture is worth a thousand words.  A 360 product rotation can be up to 72, Ultra High-Definition pictures.  How many words is that worth?</p> 

                <p> With 360 product photography customers can see up to 72 different angles, zoom in on details and spin the product to complete the mental image your client needs to purchase and be satisfied with your product.   With 360 pictures clients are far more informed of the product, more likely to buy and less likely to return purchases.</p>
