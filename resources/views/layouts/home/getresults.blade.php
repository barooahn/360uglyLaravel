                <h3>Why use 360 web photos?</h3>

                <p>360 Ugly LTD is a premium web service used to increase your product sales by utilising 360 product photography on your website.  360 Images, sometimes called 3D images, can be used to show all angles of your product in a smooth, beautiful, rotation.  Not only does the buyer have more views of the product but they can choose angles they want to see.  Revolving products lead to less product returns and more product sales</p>

                <h3>Using 360 revolving products on my website</h3>

                <p>The 360 Images can be uploaded to your website and incorporated with three simple lines of code.  Simply cut and paste the code supplied with your download to your site and you will have 360/3D product displayed.  In this case the 360 product photos are called 360ProductPhoto.  It is as simple as uploading the files and copying / pasting three lines of code similar to the ones below.</p>  

                <pre><code>&lt;script src="randj.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div class="360ProductPhoto00020002">&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=\"360ProductPhoto00020002.js\">&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
